        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>When working with visible HTML elements, you must always use opening and closing tags</li>
          <li>Child elements are nestled inside other elements</li>
          <li>Parent elements hold the child elements</li>
          <li>Semantic elements have a name that describes its content and role, which makes code easier to read</li>
          <li>A header appears at the top and usually contains a navigation menu and/or introductory content</li>
          <li>When using headings, its important to use in order from h1 to h6. The biggest heading, h1, should only appear once</li>
          <li>A footer goes at the bottom, usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap and navigation</li>
          <li>A section, is a semantic element that defines sections in a document and allows organization of content based on topics</li>
          <li>h1-h6 defines level of heading</li>
          <li>p defines a paragraph or block of text</li>
          <li>ul defines an unordered list (bullets)</li>
          <li>ol defines an ordered list (numbered)</li>
          <li>li defines list items</li>
          <li>img defines information about images, src attribute defines location of  image</li>
          <li>br defines a line of empty space, line break between two blocks of content</li>
          <li>a is for anchor, creates links. href attribute points to URL for link</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>Inline style sheet: styles apply directly to specific element, good for quick and permanent changes, less flexible since each inline style must be edited when making changes</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet: embeded directly into HTML file, style element in head element, rules apply only to that page, single change to CSS rule will apply to all tagged elements</li>
          <li>External style sheet: most common, can keep all CSS rules in separate file, making changes easier. Link file using link element in HTMLs head element</li>
          <li>rel= defines relationship between style sheet and html</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns: separating code into different files based on use. Each section of code should have its own responsibility</li>
          <li>CSS rule is structured with a selector and declaration block, declaration block has declarations made of properties and their values</li>
          <li>A selector defines elements or attributes to which rules/declarations apply</li>
          <li>A * selector indicates that all elements on a page will have the same style properties</li>
          <li>You can combine two selectors with a comma, allowing declaration to affect both selectors, such as header, footer</li>
          <li>DRY code: Do Not Reapeat Yourself code, 2 or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together. This reduces the number of lines of code and size and complexity</li>
          <li>text-align: postion property, a way to centre title/heading, can also apply to images</li>
          <li>display:block : assigns each image to start on a new line</li>
          <li>class attribute as selector, adds styles to certain elements of choice, but not all.</li>
          <li>colours can be added by semantic references or hexadecimal code, or hex#</li>
